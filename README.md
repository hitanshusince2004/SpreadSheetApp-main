## ⚡ Key Implementation Details

### Data Management
- Uses React's \`useState\` for local state management
- Immutable data updates for optimal performance
- Efficient filtering and sorting with \`useMemo\`

### User Experience
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Double-click to edit cells
- Visual focus indicators
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Code Quality
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Semantic HTML for accessibility
- Clean component architecture

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized computations for filtering/sorting
- Efficient re-rendering with proper key props
- Lazy rendering for large datasets

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met

1. ✅ **Pixel-close layout** - Matches Figma design specifications
2. ✅ **Spreadsheet experience** - Full Google Sheets-like functionality
3. ✅ **No dead UI** - All buttons and tabs are interactive with console logging
4. ✅ **Code quality** - Passes \`npm run lint\` and \`npm run type-check\`
5. ✅ **Clean commits** - Meaningful commit messages and history

## 🌟 Stretch Features Implemented

- ✅ **Keyboard navigation** - Full arrow key support within the grid
- ✅ **Column operations** - Resize indicators and hide/show toggles
- ✅ **Advanced filtering** - Multi-criteria filtering system
- ✅ **Enhanced UX** - Focus states, hover effects, and visual feedback

## 🔧 Technical Trade-offs

### State Management
- **Choice**: Local React state instead of Redux/Zustand
- **Reason**: Application size doesn't justify external state management
- **Trade-off**: May need refactoring for larger scale applications

### Table Implementation
- **Choice**: Custom table component vs react-table
- **Reason**: Better control over styling and performance
- **Trade-off**: More initial development time but better customization

### Styling Approach
- **Choice**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Reason**: Rapid development and consistent design system
- **Trade-off**: Longer class names but better maintainability

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large datasets (1000+ rows)
- [ ] Drag and drop row reordering
- [ ] Cell format validation
- [ ] Export to CSV/Excel functionality
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality

## 📝 Development Notes

The application is built with modern React patterns including:
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility best practices

All interactive elements provide console feedback for testing and debugging purposes.

## 🧪 Testing the Application

Open the browser console to see logging for all interactive elements:
- Button clicks
- Tab switches
- Sort operations
- Filter applications
- Cell editing events

The application is fully functional and ready for production deployment.
